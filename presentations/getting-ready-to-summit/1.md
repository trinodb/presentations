The second episode SQL Basecamp 2 â€“ Getting ready to summit builds on the
foundation established in episode 1. Data has moved into the lakehouse, powered
by Trino, and more data is added and changed as part of normal operation. In
this episode Martin and myself look at maintaining the data in a healthy state
and explore some tips and tricks for querying data. For example, we look at data
management with procedures, analyzing data with window functions, and examine
more complex structural data.
