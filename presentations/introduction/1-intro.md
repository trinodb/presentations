## Why use this repository?

To get the word out about Trino, simplicity and consistency are &#x1f511;.

Users will be looking at many diagrams that describe Trino. Having to reinterpret 
each new diagram because of a novel presentation is fatiguing and not fun.

Sticking with a consistent style and visual language allows users to use what 
they already know faster, and with less effort.
