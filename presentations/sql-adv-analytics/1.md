## Lambda expressions overview

Lambda expression with one input:

```sql
x -> x + 8
```

Lambda expression with two inputs:

```sql
(x, y) -> x + y
```

## JSON data type

```sql
SELECT
  json_parse('null') j_null,
  json_parse('true') bool,
  json_parse('"hello"') string,
  json_parse('123.45') number,
  json_parse('[1, 3, 5, 9]') array,
  json_parse('["hello", 123, {"xyz": 99, "abc": false}]') mixed;
```

-vertical
## Extraction using JSONPath

```sql
SELECT json_extract(v, '$.languages') AS languages,
       json_extract(v, '$.languages[0].name') AS name_json,
       json_extract_scalar(v, '$.languages[0].name') AS name_scalar
FROM (VALUES JSON '
    {"languages": [{"name": "Java"}, {"name": "Python"}]}
') AS t (v);
```

-vertical
## Casting from JSON

```sql
SELECT cast(v AS map(varchar,array(map(varchar,varchar))))
FROM (VALUES JSON '
    {"languages": [{"name": "Java"}, {"name": "Python"}]}
') AS t (v);
```

-vertical
## Partial casting from JSON

```sql
SELECT cast(v AS map(varchar,array(map(varchar,json))))

    {"languages":
        [{"id": 123, "name": "Java", "data": [88,99]},
         {"id": 456, "name": "Python"}]}

## Advanced Aggregation Techniques

## Counting distinct items

How many unique customers do we have?

```sql
SELECT count(DISTINCT custkey) AS customers
FROM orders;
```

This gives an exact answer, but is slow and memory intensive.

-vertical
## Counting distinct items

Approximately how many unique customers do we have?

```sql
SELECT approx_distinct(custkey) AS customers
FROM orders;
```

This example has an error of 1.66%.

-vertical
##  Counting distinct items

From the `approx_distinct()` documentation:

<p class="r-fit-text">This function should produce a standard error of 2.3%, which is the standard
deviation of the (approximately normal) error distribution over all possible
sets. It does not guarantee an upper bound on the error for any specific input
set.
</p>

<p class="r-fit-text">
The function uses the HyperLogLog  algorithm to approximate the number of
distinct items. The error depends on the unique values, not how many times they
appear in the input. Both of these produce the same error:</p>

```sql
approx_distinct(x)
approx_distinct(DISTINCT x)
```

-vertical
##  Approximate percentiles

What is the order price at the 50th percentile?

```sql
SELECT round(avg(price)) AS avg,
       approx_percentile(price, 0.5) AS pct
FROM (
  SELECT cast(round(totalprice) AS bigint) AS price
  FROM orders
);
```

-vertical
##  Approximate percentiles

What are the order prices at the 10th, 20th, 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles?

```sql
SELECT approx_percentile(price, array[0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99]) AS pct
FROM (
  SELECT cast(round(totalprice) AS bigint) AS price
  FROM orders
);
```

-vertical
## Associated max value

Find the clerk who has the most expensive order:

```sql
SELECT max_by(clerk, totalprice) clerk,
       max(totalprice) price
FROM orders;
```

-vertical
## Associated max value using a row type

Find the clerk who has the most expensive order:

```sql
SELECT max(cast(row(totalprice, clerk) AS
           row(price double, clerk varchar))).*
FROM orders;
```

-vertical
## Associated max values

Find the clerks who have the most expensive orders:

 ```sql
 SELECT max_by(clerk, totalprice, 3) clerks
 FROM orders;

## Pivoting with conditional counting

Order counts by order priority, as separate columns:

```sql
SELECT
  count_if(orderpriority = '1-URGENT') AS urgent,
  count_if(orderpriority = '2-HIGH') AS high,
  count_if(orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM') AS medium,
  count_if(orderpriority = '4-NOT SPECIFIED') AS not_specified,
  count_if(orderpriority = '5-LOW') AS low
FROM orders;
```

  count(*) FILTER (WHERE orderpriority = '1-URGENT') AS urgent,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE orderpriority = '2-HIGH') AS high,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM') AS medium,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE orderpriority = '4-NOT SPECIFIED') AS not_specified,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE orderpriority = '5-LOW') AS low

## Aggregating a complex expression

What if we charge a premium based on order priority?

```sql
SELECT avg(totalprice *
           CASE
             WHEN orderpriority = '1-URGENT' THEN 1.10
             WHEN orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1.05
             ELSE 1.0
           END) / avg(totalprice) AS premium

## Accessing leading and trailing rows

Access a value in the row behind and ahead of the current row:

```sql
SELECT name,
       lag(name) OVER (ORDER BY name) AS lag,
       lead(name) OVER (ORDER BY name) AS lead

## Accessing leading and trailing rows

Access a value in the row behind and ahead of the current row, with default:

```sql
SELECT name,
       lag(name, 1, 'none') OVER (ORDER BY name) AS lag,
       lead(name, 1, 'none') OVER (ORDER BY name) AS lead
FROM region

##  Accessing leading and trailing rows

Access a value two rows back and two rows ahead, with default:

```sql
SELECT name,
       lag(name, 2, 'none') OVER (ORDER BY name) AS lag2,
       lead(name, 2, 'none') OVER (ORDER BY name) AS lead2

## Accessing leading and trailing rows with nulls

Access a value in the row behind and ahead of the current row, respecting nulls:

```sql
SELECT id, v,
       lag(v) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS lag,
       lead(v) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS lead
FROM (VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, null), (4, 'd'), (5, null)) AS t (id, v)
ORDER BY id;

  2 | b    | a    | NULL 
  3 | NULL | b    | d    
  4 | d    | NULL | NULL 
  5 | NULL | d    | NULL 

-vertical
## Accessing leading and trailing rows without nulls

Access a value in the row behind and ahead of the current row, ignoring nulls:

```sql
SELECT id, x,
       lag(x) IGNORE NULLS OVER (ORDER BY id) AS lag,
       lead(x) IGNORE NULLS OVER (ORDER BY id) AS lead
FROM (VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, null), (4, 'd'), (5, null)) AS t (id, x)
ORDER BY id;
```

  2 | b    | a    | d    
  3 | NULL | b    | d    
  4 | d    | b    | NULL 
  5 | NULL | d    | NULL

## Window frames

Each row in a partition has a frame:

* ROWS: physical frame based on an exact number of rows
* RANGE: logical frame that includes all rows that are peers within the ordering

Examples:

* `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
* `RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`
* `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING`
* `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
* `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING`
* `ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`
