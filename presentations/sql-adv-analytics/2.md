## Analyzing more data

More catalogs, schemas, tables, joins and relations result in too much data.

Time to reduce the amount to gather insights.

## Filtered results

* Narrowing the selection of returned rows
* `WHERE` clause
* Simple example with equality check:

```sql
SELECT r.name AS region, n.name AS nation
FROM tpch.tiny.nation AS n
JOIN tpch.tiny.region AS r
ON n.regionkey = r.regionkey
WHERE r.regionkey = 2
ORDER by region, nation;
```

## Combination of multiple conditions

* Use [logical operators](https://trino.io/docs/current/functions/logical.html#effect-of-null-on-logical-operators):
* `AND`
* `OR`
# `NOT`

```sql
SELECT name
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
WHERE regionkey=1
OR regionkey=2
AND name<>'UNITED STATES';
```

-vertical
## Time to think

Do you need brackets for this query to return the desired results?

```sql
SELECT name
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
WHERE (regionkey=1 AND NOT name='UNITED STATES')
OR regionkey=2;
```

You don't for this order. Boolean logic gives priority to `AND` over `OR`.

Try changing and find out. If in doubt, use brackets `()`.

## Try to compare values

Lots of [comparison functions and operators](https://trino.io/docs/current/functions/comparison.html)

* `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `<>` or `!=`
* Ranges with `BETWEEN`
* Pattern matching with `LIKE` and `_` or `%`
* Compare with list of values with `IN`
* More power with [regular expressions](https://trino.io/docs/current/functions/regexp.html)

## Greater than

```sql
SELECT totalprice, custkey
FROM tpch.tiny.orders
WHERE totalprice > 400000;
```

-vertical
## In a range of values

```sql
SELECT totalprice, custkey
FROM tpch.tiny.orders
WHERE totalprice BETWEEN 420000 AND 450000;
```

-vertical
## IN

Compared to a list of values.

```sql
SELECT name FROM tpch.tiny.region
WHERE name NOT IN ('ASIA', 'MIDDLE EAST');
```

Values can come from a subquery.

-vertical
## Sorting results

* User `ORDER BY`
* One or more columns
* Ascending `ASC` or descending `DESC` order
* Subset of data with `LIMIT`

```sql
SELECT name
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
ORDER BY name DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

-vertical
## Sorting and subqueries gotcha

* Subquery data is just a result set
* Ordering is ignored
* Only `ORDER BY` from top level matters
