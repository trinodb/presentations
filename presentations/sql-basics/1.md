# SQL basics

Let's get going.

## Where do you start

* A Trino <span style="color:#f88600">cluster</span> is up and running.
* Data sources are connected as <span style="color:#f88600">catalogs</span>.
* Your <span style="color:#f88600">client</span> tool of choice is connected.

> Now you can run SQL queries with Trino!

-vertical
## SQL is declarative, not procedural

A typical SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
WHERE name LIKE 'M%';
```

* Declarative: Get all nation names that start with `M`.
* Procedural: Load all nations, loop through all, check each name if it starts
  with `M`, filter others out, return them.

> You don't need to worry about the **how**, just specify the **what**.

## Categories of statements

* Globally available
* Read operations - *analytics*
* Write operations - *data creation and manipulation*
* Security operations - *access control*

-vertical
## Globally available statements

* `USE catalog.schema`
* `EXPLAIN` / `EXPLAIN ANALYSE`
* `SET|RESET|SHOW SESSION` - user specific configuration
* `SHOW FUNCTIONS`
* And numerous others

-vertical
## Metadata read operations

* `SHOW CATALOGS`
* `SHOW SCHEMAS`
* `SHOW TABLES`
* `SHOW COLUMNS` / `DESCRIBE`
* `SHOW CREATE *`
* `SHOW GRANTS` and `SHOW ROLES`
* `SHOW STATS`

Let's explore.

## Read operations

> The power of any analytics query - `SELECT`

More details later ...

-vertical
## Read operations

* Available with all connectors
* Minimum requirement for a connector

-vertical
## Write operations

* Data management
* Materialized view management
* Schema and table management
* View management

> Changing data and structure.

-vertical
## Write operations

* Very different coverage per connector

-vertical
## Lots more power

All prior statements are already very powerful, but there is more:

* Scalar, aggregate, and table functions
* Operators
* SQL routines and user-defined functions

-vertical
## Another classification

* Data Query Language (DQL)
  * `SELECT`, ...
* Data Definition Language (DDL)
  * `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE`, `DELETE`, ...
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  * `CREATE|ALTER|DROP TABLE`, ...
* Data Control Language (DCL)
  * `GRANT`, `REVOKE`,`DENY`, ...

-notes
Mostly for completeness so you know if this comes up.
