Insights and understanding

from looking at your data.

## SELECT statement

 The main powerhouse

```
[ WITH [ RECURSIVE ] with_query [, ...] ]
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] select_expression [, ...]
[ FROM from_item [, ...] ]
[ WHERE condition ]
[ GROUP BY [ ALL | DISTINCT ] grouping_element [, ...] ]
[ HAVING condition]
[ WINDOW window_definition_list]
[ { UNION | INTERSECT | EXCEPT } [ ALL | DISTINCT ] select ]
[ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...] ]
[ OFFSET count [ ROW | ROWS ] ]
[ LIMIT { count | ALL } ]
[ FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } { ONLY | WITH TIES } ]
```

-vertical
## High level

* Get columns.
* From a table in a schema in a catalog.
* Consider conditions to filter data.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
WHERE name LIKE 'M%';
```

And as a result you get data in tabular format.

-notes
* minimal a null or failure
* or one row with one column
* or more

-vertical
## Data type

* Different data type for each column.
* Impacted by data source data type.
* Connector translates and maps.

Data type determines rendering, and therefore look and feel for consumer.

-notes
* This is important
* imagine rendering date as epoch millisecond ..
* or a large money amount in cent
* not very user-friendly

-vertical
## Find out data type of results

Use a prepared statement:

```sql
PREPARE test FROM
SELECT nationkey, name, comment FROM tpch.tiny.nation;

DESCRIBE OUTPUT test;
```

Shows data type details.

-vertical
## Find out data type of results, take 2

Run query with less data:

```sql
SELECT nationkey, name, comment
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
WHERE name LIKE 'M%'
LIMIT 1;
```

Show the actual rendering.

-vertical
## Easy testing

One or more values as rows

```sql
SELECT 'Today`s date: ' || CAST(current_date AS VARCHAR);
```

```sql
VALUES 'Today`s date: ' || CAST(current_date AS VARCHAR);
```

```sql
VALUES 'Today: ' || CAST(current_date AS VARCHAR),
       'Tomorrow: ' || date_format(date_add('day', 1, current_timestamp), '%Y-%m-%d');
```

No catalog needed.

-vertical
## Easy testing

One or more rows in a table

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  VALUES ('Today', CAST(current_date AS VARCHAR)),
         ('Tomorrow', date_format(date_add('day', 1, current_timestamp), '%Y-%m-%d'))
) as t(description, the_date)
ORDER BY the_date DESC;
```

No catalog needed.

-vertical
## Formatting data types

* `CAST`
* `format()` function
* Data type specific functions

-vertical
## CAST

* Casting actually affects the data type.
* Can lose information.
* Can fail.

The result can be processed with functions for other data types.

-vertical
## format() function

```sql
VALUES
  format('pi = %.5f', pi()),
  format('agent %03d', 7),
  format('$%,.2f', 1234567.89),
  format('%-7s,%7s', 'hello', 'world'),
  format('%2$s %3$s %1$s', 'a', 'b', 'c'),
  format('%1$tA, %1$tB %1$te, %1$tY', date '2006-07-04');
```

-vertical
## Data type specific functions

An example:

```sql
VALUES 'Tomorrow: ' || date_format(date_add('day', 1, current_timestamp), '%Y-%m-%d');
```

There are so many that we have a special class about functions.

-vertical
## Simple case expressions

```sql
SELECT n,
       CASE n
           WHEN 1 THEN 'one'
           WHEN 2 THEN 'two'
           ELSE 'many'
       END AS name
FROM (VALUES 1, 2, 3, 4) AS t (n);
```

-notes

 n | name 
---+------
 1 | one  
 2 | two  
 3 | many 
 4 | many 

-vertical
## Searched case expressions

```sql
SELECT n,
       CASE
           WHEN n = 1 THEN 'aaa'
           WHEN n IN (2, 3) THEN 'bbb'
           ELSE 'ccc'
       END AS name
FROM (VALUES 1, 2, 3, 4) AS t (n);
```

 -notes

n | name 
---+------
 1 | aaa  
 2 | bbb  
 3 | bbb  
 4 | ccc  

-vertical
## IF expression

```sql
SELECT format('I have %s cat%s.', n,
              IF(n = 1, '', 's')) AS text
FROM (VALUES 0, 1, 2, 3) AS t (n);
```

-notes

      text      
----------------
 I have 0 cats. 
 I have 1 cat.  
 I have 2 cats. 
 I have 3 cats. 

-vertical
## TRY expression

```sql
SELECT try(8 / 0) div_zero,
       try(cast('abc' AS integer)) not_integer,
       try(2000000000 + 2000000000) overflow;
```

TRY avoids these failures:

* Query failed: Division by zero
* Query failed: Cannot cast 'abc' to INT
* Query failed: integer addition overflow: 2000000000 + 2000000000

-notes

div_zero | not_integer | overflow 
----------+-------------+----------
     NULL |        NULL |     NULL 

-vertical
## Conditions

Narrowing down the returned data.

* In `WHERE` clause
* Multiple conditions combined with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
* Operators `<`, `>`, `=`, `<=`, `>=`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`
* Pattern matching with `LIKE`, `%`, and `_`

--vertical
## Conditions

A simple example for a large topic:

```sql
SELECT name, regionkey
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
WHERE name LIKE 'U%'
AND regionkey != 1;
```

-vertical
## Sorting results

* One or more columns
* Ascending or descending order
* Subset of data

```sql
SELECT name
FROM tpch.tiny.nation
ORDER BY name DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

-vertical
## Accessing multiple tables

Using `WHERE` condition for related tables:

```sql
SELECT
  r.name AS region,
  n.name AS nation
FROM
  tpch.tiny.nation AS n,
  tpch.tiny.region AS r
WHERE
  n.regionkey = r.regionkey
ORDER by region, nation;
```

This is actually a cross join with a filter on the relation.

-vertical
## Accessing multiple tables

The right way is to use `JOIN` for related tables:

```sql
SELECT
  r.name AS region,
  n.name AS nation
FROM
  tpch.tiny.nation AS n
JOIN
  tpch.tiny.region AS r
ON n.regionkey = r.regionkey
ORDER by region, nation;
```

Equivalent result, but lots more potential.

-notes

* Hint at LEFT and RIGHT
* INNER and OUTER join
* CROSS join
* and more

-vertical
## Accessing multiple tables

Observations related to Trino:

* Tables can be in different schemas.
* Tables can be in different catalogs.
* Tables can be from different data sources.
* Including data sources that do not support SQL.

> These queries are often call **federated queries**.

-vertical
## More complex features

* Aggregation with `GROUP BY`
* Window functions
* Pattern matching with `MATCH_RECOGNIZE`

-vertical
## Conclusion

> Congratulations!

We finished a first whirlwind tour.

-vertical
## How to learn more

* Use any generic SQL training material.
* Run it with Trino.
* Learn the differences from practice.
* Consult the [documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/).
* Check out our [other training classes](../../index.html#/0/1).

And practice, practice, practice.
