## Window functions and pattern matching

## Window function overview

Window functions run across rows of the result. Processing order:

1. `FROM` and `JOIN`s
2. `WHERE`
3. `GROUP BY`
4. `HAVING`
5. Window functions
6. `SELECT`
7. `DISTINCT`
8. `ORDER BY`
9. `LIMIT`

## Window frames

Each row in a partition has a frame:

* ROWS: physical frame based on an exact number of rows
* RANGE: logical frame that includes all rows that are peers within the ordering

Examples:

* `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
* `RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`
* `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING`
* `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
* `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING`
* `ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`
